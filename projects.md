This project is implemented in Android Studio, making it runnable and visually testable. It pulls from an online free source database, which is a process we would like to learn more about. Also it has recent PRs and active maintainers with detailed documentations which will guide us in understanding few of the key functions and tools of the system as we delve into and reverse engineer the project.                                                         |
