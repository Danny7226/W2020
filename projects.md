|Costco            |PreferenceFX                 |230K                        |PreferencesFX is a practical system that makes business application development easier. It has a user interface that utilizes JavaFX, which we learned last quarter and can apply our knowledge of. The visual components make the system more interesting and the clear project documentation will guide us in understanding few of the key functions and tools of the system as we delve into and reverse engineer the project.                                                         |
