|Team_Costco |forecastie       |100k+                    |Forecastie is a practical, daily-use weather application with a simple design. It implements interesting features such as location detection and maps through the public weather API, OpenWeatherMap. This project can be implemented in Android Studio, making it runnable and testable. It pulls from an online free source database, which is a process we would like to learn more about. Also, the PRs are being considered regularly and are actively and currently being maintained. The detailed documentations will guide us in understanding few of the key functions and tools of the system as we delve into and reverse engineer the project.                                                         |
